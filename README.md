Booze notes, cooperatively


Instructions
------------

1. Fork the repo to your own acct.  
2. Take notes on the booze that you drink, making each different booze a different branch.
3. Share with your friends.
4. When your friend makes a booze note that he thinks you'll like, he will submit a pull request for that branch to your repo for that booze.
5. You go try that booze.
6. If you don't like it, reject it and punch your friend next time you see him.
7. If you like it, merge the branch, and you'll have his notes along with yours.  Friends forever!
